sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: There's a big difference between sorted and random. With the worst case, random,
the running time was very slow but the best case, sorted, ran very quickly because it only
has to go through the array once.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: The running time was generally the fastest. It was the same with random and sorted list which
which corresponds with the merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: It was the slowest at both random and sorted searches. It was especially slow with the 
worst case, random, search because it keeps looking for the lowest value.
