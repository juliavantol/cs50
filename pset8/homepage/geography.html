             Norway is a country located in Northern Europe on the northern and western parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The majority of the country borders water, including
             the Skagerrak inlet to the south, the North Sea to the southwest, the North Atlantic
             Ocean (Norwegian Sea) to the west, and the
             <input type="text" id="q1" size="20"> sea to the north. It has a land border with Sweden to the
             east and a shorter border with Finland and an even shorter border with
             <input type="text" id="q2" size="20"> to the northeast.<br><br>
             Norway has an elongated shape, one of the longest and most rugged coastlines in the
             world, and some 50,000 islands off its much indented coastline. It is one of the
             world's northernmost countries, and it is one of Europe's most mountainous
             countries, with large areas dominated by the Scandinavian Mountains. The country's
             average elevation is
             <input type="text" id="q3" size="20"> metres (1,510 ft), and 32 percent of the mainland is
             located above the tree line. Its country-length chain of peaks is geologically
             continuous with the mountains of Scotland, Ireland, and, after crossing under the
             Atlantic Ocean, the
             <input type="text" id="q4" size="20">  Mountains of North America. Geologists hold that
             all these formed a single range prior to the breakup of the ancient supercontinent
             Pangaea <p></p>
             During the last glacial period, as well as in many earlier ice ages, virtually the entire
             country was covered with a thick ice sheet. The movement of the ice carved out deep valleys.
             As a result of the ice carving,
             <input type="text" id="q5" size="20"> is the world's second deepest fjord and
             <input type="text" id="q6" size="20"> is the deepest lake in Europe. When the ice melted, the sea filled many of
             these valleys, creating Norway's famous fjords. The glaciers in the higher mountain areas
             today are not remnants of the large ice sheet of the ice age—their origins are more recent.
             The regional climate was up to 1–3 °C (1.8–5.4 °F) warmer in 7000 BC to 3000 BC in the Holocene climatic
             optimum, (relative to the 1961-90 period), melting the remaining glaciers in the mountains almost completely during that period.
